                <p>Turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka play a crucial role in the conservation and protection of the turtle population. These hatcheries serve as safe havens for turtle eggs, safeguarding them from natural and human-induced threats. By providing a controlled environment, these hatcheries contribute to the preservation of endangered turtle species and help maintain the delicate ecological balance of Sri Lanka's coastal areas.</p>
                <p>One of the primary objectives of turtle hatcheries is to ensure the successful hatching of eggs and the safe release of hatchlings into the ocean. These facilities carefully monitor and protect turtle nests, minimizing the risk of predation and disturbances. They also engage in extensive research and education programs to raise awareness about the importance of turtle conservation among locals and visitors.</p>
